# Order Management System - Complete Issues and Solutions Report

## Project Overview
This document provides a comprehensive record of all issues encountered and their solutions during the development and deployment of the Order Management System, a microservices-based application built with Spring Boot, Docker, Kafka, and MySQL.

## System Architecture
- **Order Service** (Port 8081): Handles order management and JWT authentication
- **Payment Service** (Port 8082): Processes payments and communicates via Kafka
- **Notification Service** (Port 8083): Sends notifications based on events
- **Common Module**: Shared DTOs and constants
- **Kafka**: Message queuing for inter-service communication
- **MySQL**: Database for all services

## Issue #1: Service Connection Refused (ECONNREFUSED)

### Problem Description
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8082
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8083
```

### Root Cause
Services were in a "Restarting" state due to Spring Boot `ConflictingBeanDefinitionException` caused by duplicate `KafkaConfig` classes.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Identified duplicate KafkaConfig classes** in both `config/` and `kafka/` directories
2. **Merged configurations** into single `config/KafkaConfig.java` files
3. **Deleted duplicate files** to resolve bean conflicts

### Files Modified
- `payment-service/src/main/java/com/example/paymentservice/config/KafkaConfig.java`
- `notification-service/src/main/java/com/example/notificationservice/config/KafkaConfig.java`
- Deleted duplicate `kafka/KafkaConfig.java` files

## Issue #2: Socket Hang Up Errors

### Problem Description
```
Error: socket hang up
```

### Root Cause
This error appeared after initial connection issues were addressed, but underlying `ConflictingBeanDefinitionException` persisted due to Docker using cached images.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Complete Docker rebuild** with cache clearing
2. **Aggressive Docker cleanup** commands:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker system prune -a -f
   docker builder prune -f
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

## Issue #3: Docker Build Failures

### Problem Description
```
failed to calculate checksum of ref ... "/common": not found
```

### Root Cause
Dockerfiles were trying to copy `common` and service-specific directories from incorrect build contexts, failing to access the common module during multi-module Maven builds.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Updated docker-compose.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   build:
     context: .
     dockerfile: payment-service/Dockerfile
   ```

2. **Converted to multi-stage Dockerfiles** for all services:
   - **Stage 1 (Build)**: Maven image with full project context
   - **Stage 2 (Runtime)**: JRE image with built JARs

3. **Modified build process**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Copy entire project
   COPY . .
   
   # Build common module first
   RUN cd common && mvn clean install -DskipTests
   
   # Build service module
   RUN cd payment-service && mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

### Files Modified
- `docker-compose.yaml` - Updated build contexts
- `payment-service/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build
- `notification-service/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build  
- `order-service/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build

## Issue #4: Windows File Locking Issues

### Problem Description
```
Could not delete 'C:\Users\Hp\OneDrive\Desktop\Project-hcl\Order_Management\order-service\target\classes\com\example\orderservice\security\CustomUserDetailsService.class'
```

### Root Cause
Windows file locking preventing deletion of compiled classes during rebuild process.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Stopped all Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Force-removed target directories**:
   ```bash
   rmdir /s /q order-service\target
   rmdir /s /q payment-service\target
   rmdir /s /q notification-service\target
   rmdir /s /q common\target
   ```

3. **Alternative PowerShell commands**:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force order-service\target
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force payment-service\target
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force notification-service\target
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force common\target
   ```

## Issue #5: Linter Errors and Unused Imports

### Problem Description
```
The import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication is never used
The import org.springframework.security.core.authority.AuthorityUtils is never used
```

### Root Cause
Unused imports in `JwtAuthFilter.java` after refactoring.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Cleaned up unused imports** in `JwtAuthFilter.java`
2. **Ensured proper imports** for `SecurityContextHolder` and other required classes

## Issue #6: JWT Authentication 403 Forbidden Error

### Problem Description
```
403 Forbidden error during JWT testing
```

### Root Cause
`JwtAuthFilter` was throwing `BadCredentialsException` on validation failure instead of gracefully continuing the filter chain, preventing proper error handling.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Refactored JwtAuthFilter**:
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Modified error handling to log errors and continue filter chain
   - Removed direct exception throwing

2. **Updated SecurityConfig**:
   - Added `PasswordEncoder` bean (`BCryptPasswordEncoder`)
   - Enabled CORS configuration
   - Permitted `/error` endpoint access

3. **Enhanced JwtService**:
   - Modernized JJWT API usage (`io.jsonwebtoken.security.Keys`)
   - Added comprehensive token validation methods
   - Improved error handling and logging

4. **Updated AuthController**:
   - Added try-catch blocks for better error handling
   - Enhanced `AuthResponse` with message and success fields

5. **Improved CustomUserDetailsService**:
   - Added default "admin" user with multiple roles
   - Used `User.builder()` pattern for cleaner code

6. **Enhanced application.properties**:
   - Added debug logging for JWT-related packages
   - Configured JWT secret and expiration

### Files Modified

## Issue #7: Import Resolution Errors

### Problem Description
```
The import com.example.common cannot be resolved
PaymentEvent cannot be resolved to a type
```

### Root Cause
Common module dependencies not properly resolved in service modules.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Ensured proper Maven dependencies** in service `pom.xml` files
2. **Verified common module installation** during Docker build process
3. **Checked import paths** match actual package structure

---

## Complete Resolution Workflow

### Step-by-Step Resolution Process
1. **Stop all services**: `docker-compose down`
2. **Clear Docker cache**: `docker system prune -a -f`
3. **Remove target directories**: Force delete all `target/` folders
4. **Rebuild without cache**: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
5. **Start services**: `docker-compose up -d`
6. **Verify connectivity**: Test all service endpoints
7. **Test JWT authentication**: Login and protected endpoint access

### Key Docker Commands Used
```bash
# Stop and clean
docker-compose down
docker system prune -a -f
docker builder prune -f

# Rebuild and start
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
```

### Key Maven Commands Used
```bash
# Clean and install common module
cd common && mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Build service modules
cd [service-name] && mvn clean package -DskipTests
```
